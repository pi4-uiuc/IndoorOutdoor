## Team Members

* Sravani Vadali (vvadali2@illinois.edu)
* Yuji Yang (yujiy2@illinois.edu)
* Ran Ji (ranj2@illinois.edu)
## Questions
* Are different genotypes affected by their environment (indoor vs outdoor) different?
* Do different measurements of growth (height vs plant area vs root length) have the same indoor-outdoor relationship?
## Important Variables
* Genotype
* Height
* Height-to-width ratio
* Leaf area
* Plant color
* Soil (acidity, moisture, density)
* Weather/greenhouse conditions
## Analyses
* Linear modeling
* Regression plots
* Machine learning
* Data cleaning
