## Questions
* Are different genotypes affected by their environment (indoor vs outdoor) different?
* Do different measurements of growth (height vs plant area vs root length) have the same indoor-outdoor relationship?
## Data Types
* Genotype
* Height
* Leaf area
* Soil (acidity, moisture, density)
* Weather/greenhouse conditions
## Analyses
* Linear modeling
* Regression plots
